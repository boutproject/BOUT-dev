 * Inversion of parallel derivatives
 *
 * Inverts a matrix of the form
 *
 * A + B * Grad2_par2
 *
 * Stages:
 * - Problem trivially parallel in X, so gather all data for fixed X onto
 *   a single processor. Split MXSUB locations between NYPE processors
 * - Use nearest neighbour for twist-shift location.
 *   This splits the problem into one or more (cyclic) tridiagonal problems
 *   (number depends on the q value)
 * - Solve each of these tridiagonal systems O(Nz*Ny)
 * - Scatter data back
 *
 * Author: Ben Dudson, University of York, June 2009
 *
 * Known issues:
 * ------------
 *
 * - Assumes all points are in the core: no handling of SOL / PF regions
 * - This algorithm can only use MXSUB processors, so if NYPE > MXSUB
 *   (i.e. Np > Nx) then efficiency will fall.
 * - When higher-order interpolation is used at the twist-shift location,
 *   errors can become large
