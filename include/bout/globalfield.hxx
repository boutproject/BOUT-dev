 * Gather and scatter a Field2D

 * Example
 * -------
 *
 * To create a GlobalField2D, pass a mesh pointer
 * 
 *     GlobalField2D g2d(mesh); 
 *
 * By default data is gathered and scattered to/from processor 0. 
 * To change this, pass the processor number as a second argument:
 *
 *     GlobalField3D g2d(mesh, 1); // Gather onto processor 1
 *
 * Gather and scatter methods operate on Field2D objects:
 *
 *     Field2D localdata;
 *     
 *     g2d.gather(localdata); // Gather onto one processsor
 *
 * To scatter data back, use the scatter method:
 *
 *     localdata = g2d.scatter();
 *
 * Note that both gather and scatter are collective operations, 
 * which must be performed by all processors.
 *
 * To test if the data is available on a processor, use:
 *
 *     if(g2d.dataIsLocal()) {
 *       // g2d data on this processor
 *     }
 * 
 * The data in a GlobalField2D can be accessed using (x,y,z) indexing,
 * with the index ranges given by xSize, ySize, zSize methods.
