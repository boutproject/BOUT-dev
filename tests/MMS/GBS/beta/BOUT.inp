# Simulation of BETA simple toroidal device

# The geometry is set up as a curved slab:
# X   -- Radial coordinate, increasing in major radius
# Y   -- Parallel coordinate, increasing in toroidal direction
# Z   -- Vertical coordinate
#
# The domain is periodic in both Y (toroidal) and Z (vertical) directions
# Sinks of particles and energy are placed at either side in X (radial)
# and a source is localised in X, constant in Z.
#
# A small vertical magnetic field is imposed by introducing a
# Z shift between one end of Y and the other. The angle of this shift
# is ShiftAngle, currently set to 0.1* 2*pi. This shifts a magnetic
# field-line 1/10th of the way along Z for each toroidal transit.
#
# Radial boundary conditions are potential phi = 0
# and zero gradient (Neumann) on all other fields
