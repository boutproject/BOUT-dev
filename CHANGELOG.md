# Changelog

## [v6.0.0](https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev/tree/next)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev/compare/v5.1.0...next)

### Breaking changes

- The autotools `./configure` build system has been removed
- Parsing of booleans has changed [\#2828][https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev/pull/2828] ([bendudson][https://github.com/bendudson]).
  See the [manual page](https://bout-dev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_docs/bout_options.html#boolean-expressions) for details.
- Previously, the `Solver` implementations passed the loop counter to
  the `iter` argument of `call_monitors`, but since the iteration has
  already been completed when the monitors are called, this results in
  iter always being one less than the number of completed
  monitor-steps at the point when the moniters are called, which is
  confusing. Now, monitors are called with the current number of
  completed monitor-steps.

## [v5.0.0](https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev/tree/v5.0.0)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev/compare/v4.3.2...v5.0.0)

### Breaking changes

- `BoutMesh::GlobalNy` now counts points from all y-boundaries. Previously it
  only counted points from the boundaries at the upper and lower edges of the
  logical grid, even if there was another boundary in the grid.
  [\#1829](https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev/pull/1829)
- `invert_laplace` free function removed
  [\#1834](https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev/pull/1834)
- Most factories and `create` methods standardised. Run
  `bin/bout-v5-factory-upgrader.py` on your physics models to update
  them [\#1842](https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev/pull/1842)
  [\#2087](https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev/pull/2087)
- We now use [fmt](https://fmt.dev) for all our string formatting,
  instead of the printf-style formatting. This affects calls to
  `Output`, `BoutException`/`ParseException`, `DataFile`,
  `OptionsReader`, and `MsgStack`/`TRACE`. Run
  `bin/bout-v5-format-upgrader.py` on your physics models to update
  them. [\#1847](https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev/pull/1847)
- The option `laplacexy:y_bndry_dirichlet` has been deprecated. Use
  `laplacexy:y_bndry=dirichlet` instead.
  [\#1789](https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev/pull/1789)
- The variable `BOUT_VERSION`, and the macros `REVISION`,
  `BOUT_VERSION_STRING` and `BOUT_VERSION_DOUBLE` have been replaced
  with `constexpr` variables in the `bout::version`
  namespace. `REVISION` is found in `include/bout/revision.hxx`, while
  the rest are in `include/bout/version.hxx`. Both files are generated
  at configure time. Run `bin/bout-v5-macro-upgrader.py` to
  update. [\#1920](https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev/pull/1920)
- The `MUMPS` Laplacian inversion wrapper has been removed. It is still possible
  to use `MUMPS` for Laplacian inversions through the `PETSc`
  wrapper. [\#2018](https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev/pull/2018)
- The `using namespace bout::globals` statement has been removed from
  `physics_model.hxx`, and `PhysicsModel` has gained public `mesh` and
  `dump` members. Custom `main`s, free functions and legacy models
  will need to be updated to either use `bout::globals::mesh` or
  `Field::getMesh()` in free
  functions. [\#2042](https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev/pull/2042)
- The `LaplaceShoot` Laplacian implementation was removed. There are
  very few cases, if any, where this implementation actually
  works. [\#2177](https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev/pull/2177)
- `PhysicsModel` expects the options `datadir` and `dump_format` to
  have been set; this is only a problem if you don't call
  `BoutInitialise`. [\#2062](https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev/pull/2062)
- `dz` is now a `Field2D`, and `Coordinates::zlength()` also returns a
  `Field2D`. In most cases, wrapping these in a call to `getUniform`
  in order to get a `BoutReal` will do the correct thing. If checks
  are enabled, `getUniform` will throw an exception if its argument is
  not uniform (that is, that all values are identical).
  [\#2025](https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev/pull/2025)
- The parallel boundaries `BNDRY_PAR_FWD` and `BNDRY_PAR_BKWD` have
  been expanded to distinguish between the inner and outer boundaries
  in x; the enums have been replaced with `BNDRY_PAR_*_XIN`, and
  `BNDRY_PAR_*_XOUT` for both `FWD` and
  `BKWD`. [\#2025](https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev/pull/2025)
- Support for reading/writing HDF5 files has been removed ahead of completely
  refactoring the I/O
- Support for reading/writing HDF5 files has been removed ahead of
  completely refactoring the I/O
  systems. [\#2208](https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev/pull/2208)
- Removed the Karniadakis time solver. Other choices for split-operator schemes
  are: `splitrk` (built-in), `imexbdf2` (requires PETSc), and `arkode` (requires
  SUNDIALS) [\#2241](https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev/pull/2241)
- Conversion of Option to bool is now stricter.  Previously, only tested
  (case-insensitively) if first character was 'n', 'f', '0', 'y', 't', or '1'.
  Now only allow (still case-insensitively but checking full strings) 'n',
  'no', 'f', 'false', '0', 'y', 'yes', 't', 'true', or '1'.
  [\#2282](https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev/pull/2282)
- Having any unused options remaining after the first call to the physics model
  `rhs` is now an error. Set `input:error_on_unused_options = false` for old
  behaviour [\#2210](https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev/pull/2210)
- Input options are now case sensitive. Run `bin/bout-v5-input-file-upgrader.py`
  to automatically fix the most common library options
  [\#2210](https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev/pull/2210)
- Input options are now required to be either a section or a value, and not
  both. This requires renaming the `restart` section to
  `restart_files`. `bin/bout-v5-input-file-upgrader.py` can automatically make
  this change. [\#2277](https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev/pull/2277)
- `Options` are now only implicitly-castable to types stored in the internal
  variant. Other types now require a call to `Options::as<T>()`
  [\#2341](https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev/pull/2341)
- The Laplacian inversion solver `LaplacePDD` (`"pdd"`) has been
  removed. This implementation had some quite significant drawbacks
  that made it not terribly useful in practice
  [\#3566](https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev/pull/3566)
- `Datafile` and `bout::globals::dump` have been removed in favour of
  `OptionsNetCDF`. Uses of `SAVE_ONCE/REPEAT` inside `PhysicsModel`
  code will still work for the time being; outside of `PhysicsModel`
  methods, these macros will need to be manually replaced. See the
  [file IO changes for v5 docs](https://bout-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_docs/file_io.html#changes-in-bout-v5)
  for more details. [\#2209](https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev/pull/2209)
