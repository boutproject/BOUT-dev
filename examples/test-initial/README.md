test-initial
============

Test initial conditions are created correctly for varying number of
processes. Check all the initialisation expression functions
available:

Unfortunately, the `ballooning` transform is a bit tricky to implement
in python, so this is currently skipped.

Another limitation is that it currently can't evaluate variable
references in the input file, so e.g.

    [foo]
    n = 4
    function = cos(foo:n * y)
    
won't work. This probably won't be fixed until a full expression
parser is implemented in python!

How it works
------------

`runtest` reads `data/BOUT.inp` and looks for sections that contain
the `function` attribute, ignoring three special ones, `var_x`,
`var_y`, and `var_z`, which are there simply to output the correct
coordinate grids.  Then it adds the following snippet of C++ to
`test_initial.cxx` for each of those sections that it finds:

    Field3D <name>;
    create_and_dump(<name>, "<name>");

where `<name>` is the name of each section. This creates, initialises
and writes out a `Field3D` according to the `function` attribute in
the corresponding section.

After running the test, `runtest` reads in the variables and checks
the answer against a python implementation (which in most cases is
just the Numpy implementation).
