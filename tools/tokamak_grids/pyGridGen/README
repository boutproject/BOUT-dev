                                  Python modules for pre-processing in BOUT++
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The modules included in this folder form a workflow for the creation of the input grid file for BOUT++. 
They were derived by a "translation" into python of the corresponding IDL routines in ../gridgen.
The functionality is equivalent to ../gridgen/test.pro.

=============
Dependencies:
=============

../../../tools/pylib (include in PYTHONPATH)
matplotlib/pylab
numpy
scipy
sys
bunch   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bunch
mayavi2/mlab
itertools
cPickle
netCDF4
time
copy
ode.lsode  http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~mrgates2/ode/

*Initial development on a MacOS X using Enthought Canopy 1.1 python installation. 
Most packages should be there by default except maybe mayavi2, ode.lsode and bunch.

=============
Constrains:
=============

Works well but for high normalized radius the domain functionality is not there to create dense grid around the X-point.
Some functionality, especially control arguments and smoothing, is not operational/tested yet. 

=============
Execution :
=============

python workflow.py

=============
To Do:
=============

Extend to include domains around X-points. Include all functionality (control). Involve more "pythonic" formalism.
Explore alternatives within python. More debugging.

Notes:

analyse_equil.py has 3 versions. Analyse_equil.py follows the IDL algorithm step by step. Analyse_equil_2.py is an alternative that *usually* works well. Analyse_equil_3.py is most likely the more efficient (default for now). More testing is needed.

LSODE has two options. The one uses fortran routines with a python wrapper (default since it seems faster). The alternative is using scipy's odeint. See comments in follow_gradient.py on how to change between them.
