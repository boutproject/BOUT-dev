Natural Language Support (NLS)
==============================

These are inputs for language support using gettext.

 - Template file libbout.pot : Do not edit
   This is generated by extracting strings from the BOUT++ source.
 - Language files .po which are human-readable. These contain
   translations for particular languages, and can be edited.
 - Machine readable .mo files. These are created from the .po files.

Build all .mo files:

    make

Update the template (.pot) file:

    make libbout.pot

Start a new translation:

    make po-XX

where XX is the language e.g. "de" for German, or a language_country code e.g. "de_DE".
This will update a .po file if it already exists.
Edit the .po file, translating or deleting new entries, then remake the .mo files.
