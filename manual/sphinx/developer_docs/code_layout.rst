Code layout
===========

BOUT++ is organised into classes and groups of functions which operate
on them: It’s not purely object-oriented, but takes advantage of many of
C++’s object-oriented features.

:numref:`fig-layout1` shows the most important parts of BOUT++ and how
they fit together.

.. _fig-layout1:
.. figure:: ../figs/layout1.*
   :alt: Overview of BOUT++ control flow

   Overview of BOUT++ control flow during initialisation (red), and
   running (blue)

The initialisation process is shown in red: basic information is first
read from the grid file (e.g. size of the grid, topology etc.), then
the user-supplied initialisation code is called. This code can read
other variables from the grid, and makes at least one call to
`PhysicsModel::bout_solve` to specify a variable to be evolved. The
main thing `bout_solve <PhysicsModel::bout_solve>` does is to add
these variables to the solver.

The process of running a timestep is shown in blue in
:numref:`fig-layout1`: The main loop calls the solver, which in turn
calls PVODE. To evolve the system PVODE makes calls to the RHS
function inside solver. This moves data between PVODE and BOUT++, and
calls the user-supplied `PhysicsModel::rhs` code to calculate
time-derivatives. Much of the work calculating time-derivatives
involves differential operators.

Calculation of the `RHS function <PhysicsModel::rhs>`, and handling of
data in BOUT++ involves many different
components. :numref:`fig-layout2` shows (most) of the classes and
functions involved, and the relationships between them. Some thought
was put into how this should be organised, but it has also changed
over time, so some parts could be cleaner.

Directories
-----------

The source code for the core of BOUT++ is divided into include files
(which can be used in physics models) in ``bout++/include``, and source
code and low-level includes in ``bout++/src``. Many parts of the code
are defined by their interface, and can have multiple different
implementations. An example is the time-integration solvers: many
different implementations are available, some of which use external
libraries, but all have the same interface and can be used
interchangeably. This is reflected in the directory structure inside
``bout++/src``. A common pattern is to store individual implementations
of an interface in a subdirectory called ``impls``.

::

    include/foo.hxx
    src/.../foo.cxx
    src/.../foo_factory.hxx
    src/.../foo_factory.cxx
    src/.../impls/one/one.hxx
    src/.../impls/one/one.cxx

where ``foo.hxx`` defines the interface, ``foo.cxx`` implements common
functions used in several implementations. ``foo_factory`` creates new
implementations, and is the only file which includes all the
implementations. Individual implementations are stored in their own
subdirectories of ``impls``. Components which follow this pattern
include ``fileio`` formats, ``invert/laplace`` and ``invert/parderiv``
inversion codes, ``mesh``, and ``solver``.

The current source code files are:

- :doc:`bout++.cxx<../_breathe_autogen/file/bout_09_09_8cxx>`: Main
  file which initialises, runs and finalises BOUT++. Currently
  contains a `main()` function, though this is being removed shortly.

- field

   - :doc:`field2d.cxx<../_breathe_autogen/file/field2d_8cxx>`
     implements the `Field2D` class. This is a scalar field which
     varies only in :math:`x` and :math:`y` and is used for things
     like metric tensor components and initial profiles. It supplies
     lots of overloaded operators and functions on these objects.

   - :doc:`field3d.cxx<../_breathe_autogen/file/field3d_8cxx>`
     implements the `Field3D` class, which varies in :math:`x`,
     :math:`y` and :math:`z`. Since these handle a lot more memory
     than Field2D objects, the memory management is more complicated
     and includes reference counting. See section
     :ref:`sec-memorymanage` for more details.

   - :doc:`field_data.cxx<../_breathe_autogen/file/field__data_8cxx>`
     Implements some functions in the `FieldData` class. This is a
     mainly pure virtual interface class which is inherited by
     `Field2D` and `Field3D`.

   - :doc:`fieldperp.cxx<../_breathe_autogen/file/fieldperp_8cxx>`
     implements a `FieldPerp` class to store slices perpendicular to
     the magnetic field i.e. they are a function of :math:`x` and
     :math:`z` only. This is mainly used for Laplacian inversion
     routines, and needs to be integrated with the other fields
     better.

   - :doc:`initialprofiles.cxx<../_breathe_autogen/file/initialprofiles_8cxx>`
     routines to set the initial values of fields when a simulation
     first starts. Reads settings from the option file based on the name
     of the variable.

   - :doc:`vecops.cxx<../_breathe_autogen/file/vecops_8cxx>` a
     collection of function to operate on vectors.  Contains things
     like ``Grad``, ``Div`` and ``Curl``, and uses a combination of
     field differential operators (in
     :doc:`difops.cxx<../_breathe_autogen/file/difops_8cxx>`) and
     metric tensor components (in `Mesh`).

   - :doc:`vector2d.cxx<../_breathe_autogen/file/vector2d_8cxx>`
     implements the `Vector2D` class, which uses a `Field2D` object
     for each of its 3 components. Overloads operators to supply
     things like dot and cross products.

   - :doc:`vector3d.cxx<../_breathe_autogen/file/vector3d_8cxx>`
     implements `Vector3D` by using a `Field3D`
     object for each component.

   - :doc:`where.cxx<../_breathe_autogen/file/where_8cxx>` supplies
     functions for choosing between values based on selection
     criteria.

- fileio

   - :doc:`datafile.cxx<../_breathe_autogen/file/datafile_8cxx>`
     supplies an abstract `DataFile` interface for data
     input and output. Handles the conversion of data in fields and
     vectors into blocks of data which are then sent to a specific
     file format.
